# MVV â€” MIDI Velocity Visualizer

## Synopsys

[MVV](https://omakoto.github.io/mvv/) is an online MIDI input visualizer, created for piano learners.

## Keys

- `F1` hide screen
- `R` Record start/stop
- `SPACE` Playback start/stop
  - `Left`/`Right` during playback -- Rewind/Fast-forward
- `S` Save the last recording as a midi file
